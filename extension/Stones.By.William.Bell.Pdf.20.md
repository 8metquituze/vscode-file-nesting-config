Julia Duckworth, who had lost her husband Herbert Duckworth in 1870, became acquainted with Leslie Stephen through her friendship with his first wife Harriet Marian (Minny) Thackeray's elder sister Anne (Anny) Isabella Ritchie. Julia admired Leslie's writings on religion and philosophy, which expressed an agnostic worldview that challenged the conventional beliefs of the Victorian era. Julia was one of the witnesses of Minny's tragic death from eclampsia in 1875[22] and afterwards, she took care of Leslie and his daughter Laura, who suffered from mental illness. She helped them move to a house next door to hers on Hyde Park Gate, where Laura could have some companionship with Julia's three children from her first marriage.[23][24][25][26] Julia and Leslie developed a close friendship and a passionate correspondence, but they both felt that their relationship should not go beyond that, as they were still grieving for their spouses.[e][27][28] However, when Anny married her cousin Richmond Ritchie in 1877, Julia changed her mind and accepted Leslie's proposal of marriage. They were married on 26 March 1878 in St. George's Church, Hanover Square. Leslie and Laura then moved into Julia's house, where they formed a blended family with Julia's children and had four more children of their own. They lived there happily until Leslie's death in 1904. At the time of their marriage, Julia was 32 years old and Leslie was 46.[21][*incomplete short citation*][29]
